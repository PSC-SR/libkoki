title: "camera functionality: opening, loading params, grabbing frames, closing"
desc: |-
  A large chunk of functionality that is closely related.
  This will involve interacting with V4L2 for grabbing frames.
  Params (resolution, focal length, etc...) should be stored on disk and read in -- calibration only needs to happen once.

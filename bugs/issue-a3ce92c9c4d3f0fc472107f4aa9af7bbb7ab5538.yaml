title: quad detection failure on almost perfectly horizontal top edge of marker
desc: |-
  When the top edge of a marker (well, any quad) in the image is rotated ever so slightly anti-clockwise (i.e. the top-left vertex is lower than the top-right), the quad detection eroneously finds 5 vertices instead of 4.
  This is because of the method used to find the first vertex.
  The current method is a scan, left to right, of the top row of the clip region until the first region pixel is found.
  When the top-right vertex is the first vertex, there can often be a gap between the identifed location and the actual location.
  In some cases, this gap is big enough for the actual top-right vertex to be added as well.

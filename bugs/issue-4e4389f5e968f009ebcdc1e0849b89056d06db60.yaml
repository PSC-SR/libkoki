title: automatic thresholding of an image
desc: |-
  Light conditions will vary -- auto thresholding is better than tweaking a threshold value
  depending on the lighting.
  
  Otsu's method (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method) or something similar could
  be used to perform this thresholding.
